# SMSDialog Module

## Description

The SMSDialog Module extends the Appcelerator Titanium Mobile framework implementing an iPhone dialog window that enables you to send in application text messages on behalf of the app user, exposing an API very similar to the one of the Ti.UI.EmailDialog object. Both recipients and body fields can be pre-populated from your application. Since v1.1.0 the module allows adding attachments to SMS or iMessage messages, thus enabling the ability to send MMSs.
